# feather-led operation

The client exposes two services:

1. The **configure** service, a RESTful GET/PUT/DELETE (POST not supported) that sends a configuration to the client. The configuration consists of two parts: the common configuration that covers such items as timing and interfaces, and a set of special instructions that accounts for specific semantics.
2. The **operate** service, which is a RESTful GET/PUT/DELETE (POST not supported) that sets an operating mode (run, off, single). DELETE disables the client.
